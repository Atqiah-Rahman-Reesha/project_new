  <h1>FOODIE US</h1>
  <p>a Reach Food Service was founded by a team of professionals with a passion for world cuisine and the expertise to support the most creative, innovative chefs in the world. 

Created around the Gourmet Seafood division as the core business, REACH caters to the premium end of the London Food service market.  The product range is a well-balanced mix of both imported and locally sourced fish and shellfish.   We have expanded our product range to include fine pastry ingredients and artisanal cheeses

With an eye for quality and a sense of adventure, our passion has taken us beyond the frontiers of England to create a portfolio of seafood from the exotic seafood markets of the Far East, from the extensive shrimp farms in South East Asia, and from the depths of the of the icy cold Antarctic seas.   </p>
